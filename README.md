# ButonulAscuns

Let's create a page that contains 3 buttons. 
On page load, one of the buttons will be randomly chosen as the winner and the rest of the buttons as losers.

The user viewing the page will click on the buttons. 
Display an appropriate message when each button is pressed (winner or loser).

//Bonus 
Create an input and a button to generate. 
The user will enter a number n, and when the button is pressed, n buttons will be generated. One of the n buttons will be the winner (chosen at random).

Result: https://alexandrulog.github.io/ButonulAscuns/
